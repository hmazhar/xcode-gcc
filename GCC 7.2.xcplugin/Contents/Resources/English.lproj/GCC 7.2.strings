The resulting code is often both smaller and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition, when a function is recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use information about that function to warn about problems with calls to that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the resulting code still contains calls to that function.

This switch is needed if the target function will lie outside of the 64 megabyte addressing range of the offset based version of subroutine call instruction.

Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls will be turned into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions, functions which have the short-call attribute, functions that are inside the scope of a #pragma no_long_calls directive and functions whose definitions have already been compiled within the current compilation unit, will not be turned into long calls.  The exception to this rule is that weak function definitions, functions with the long-call attribute or the section attribute, and functions that are within the scope of a #pragma long_calls directive, will always be turned into long calls.

This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying -mno-long-calls will restore the default behavior, as will placing the function calls within the scope of a #pragma long_calls_off directive.

Enabling this option will exclude certain compiler options from that hash.  Presently this option will exclude search path options (-I, -iquote, -isystem, -F, -L) from the hash.

Enabling increased sharing of PCH files carries some risk: If two targets use the same prefix header but have different include paths which cause the prefix header to include different files when they are precompiled, then subtle problems may result because one target will use a PCH which was built using files included by the other target.
